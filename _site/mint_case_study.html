<h2 id="project-objectives">Project Objectives</h2>

<p>By extending the Mint app, our team hopes to further motivate young students to be more active in saving money.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>For young students, saving money can be extremely stressful and seem impossible. It’s generally always so much easier to spend money than save it, especially with small purchases. What’s $3 here, and $5 there, after all? But when faced with a highly desired item of an unfortunately equally high cost, it’s more difficult to just buy it right then and there without thinking about the painful hole it’ll leave in your wallet. In which case, some may opt for the option of saving up for such a purchase, instead. However, it’s difficult to save up by sheer willpower while constantly spending on other things, and it’s easy to become demotivated from constantly checking bank applications or money management apps like Mint. Such applications are very general and stationary in financial planning, and do little besides just listing numbers. Therefore, our project aims to help youths learning to manage their money stay motivated to consistently save up for a high-cost purchase.</p>

<h2 id="target-user">Target User</h2>

<p>Our team has decided to use young students as our target user. We believe the younger generation of students are an ideal target user for the following reasons.</p>

<h4 id="importance-of-users-students-should-learn-at-a-younger-age-to-start-saving-money-whether-it-would-be-for-big-or-small-purchases-this-would-allow-saving-money-to-grow-into-a-beneficial-habit">Importance of Users: <span style="font-weight:normal">Students should learn at a younger age to start saving money whether it would be for big or small purchases; this would allow saving money to grow into a beneficial habit.</span></h4>

<h4 id="access-to-users-as-our-team-is-comprised-of-college-students-we-believe-that-our-team-could-easily-survey-the-abundance-of-freshmen-at-our-ever-expanding-university-within-5-miles">Access to Users: <span style="font-weight:normal">As our team is comprised of college students, we believe that our team could easily survey the abundance of freshmen at our ever expanding university within 5 miles.</span></h4>

<h4 id="magnitude-of-user-need-from-our-own-experiences-and-casual-observations-our-team-believes-that-there-is-a-significant-amount-of-students-do-not-have-good-spending-habits-and-fail-to-save-for-large-purchases">Magnitude of User Need: <span style="font-weight:normal">From our own experiences and casual observations, our team believes that there is a significant amount of students do not have good spending habits and fail to save for large purchases.</span></h4>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="user-goals">User Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Users (young students) should be able to:</li>
  <li>successfully save for a major purchase</li>
  <li>consistently stay motivated throughout their saving towards the purchase</li>
  <li>minimize other needless spending / expenditures</li>
  <li>fully enjoy their major purchase after saving up for it
<br />
<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-the-big-question-why"><span style="font-size: 30px"> <b><i>The Big Question, Why?</i></b></span></h2>

<p>At some point in their life, everyone experienced having a flow of income for their first time. For many, it can be overwhelming.  But as time goes on, we all realize that a little effort done periodically can go a long way. Budgeting rules out there allow people to save efficiently and safely month after month to meet the user’s needs. Similarly, setting money aside to accumulate for certain purchases has many benefits.
It can be extremely effective in making something like saving money more fun and simple. With a lighthearted money saving app, focused on achievements and user satisfaction, the biggest issue in money management will be tackled: motivation. This can be expanded to an even more educational sense in teaching yourself or your children for instance, the importance of saving its rewards.</p>

<h1 id="-the-problem"><span style="font-size: 45px"> <b>The Problem</b></span></h1>

<p>Young students especially those who are interested in personal finance need to be more motivated when using personal finance apps in order to promote a more active effort towards saving money.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-to-user-research">Connecting to User Research</h2>

<p>Our survey process allowed us to gain an understanding of our target group students, but specifically teens and young adults with their first jobs. Many of the answers converged, and brought to light many problems that people face when trying to save. We notice that about 67% of the survey participants believe they have good control over their money; however, very rarely, do they commit to large purchases through periodic saving. Instead, big purchases are generally completed when the money is available. In addition to that, 88.8% of the survey participants believed that a motivation factor within a money management app would be effective in keeping them committed.</p>
