<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="a-brief-intro">A Brief Intro</h2>

<p>As part of UC San Diego’s “Designing Human-Data Interactions” course, I was tasked in a team of three to extend or redesign a feature that helps a specific type of user to save for a major upcoming high-cost purchase.
Within the ten-week time frame of the course, our team learned about the 
UX/product design process that included need finding, competitive audits, and
 high-fidelity prototyping.<br />
  <br /> My main roles in this project were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to keep the project as realistic as possible by gathering as much user
   feedback as I can find</li>
  <li>aid in high-fidelity prototyping as I am terrible at hand sketching but 
  adept at digital design.</li>
  <li>manage competitive analysis/audits to shape our design as a form of 
  regression testing
  <br /></li>
</ul>

<p>I view these three roles as very important especially the one with the 
  competitive analysis and auditing because change within the design process happens very 
  often; it tends to cover up our old decisions and the reasons why the 
  decisions were essential in the first place.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="our-objective">Our Objective</h2>

<p>By extending the Mint app, our team hopes to further motivate young students to be more active in saving money.</p>

<h2 id="our-user">Our User</h2>

<p>Our team has decided to use young students as our target user. We believe the younger generation of students are an ideal target user because students should learn at a younger age to start saving money whether it would be for big or small purchases; this would allow saving money to grow into a beneficial habit.</p>

<h2 id="user-goals">User Goals</h2>

<p>By using our feature, our users should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>successfully save for a major purchase</li>
  <li>consistently stay motivated throughout their saving towards the purchase</li>
  <li>minimize other needless spending / expenditures</li>
  <li>fully enjoy their major purchase after saving up for it
<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-the-problem"><span style="font-size: 45px"> <b>The Problem</b></span></h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Young students especially those who are interested in personal finance need to be more motivated when using personal finance apps to promote a more active effort towards saving money.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At some point in their life, everyone experienced having a flow of income for
 their first time. For many, it can be overwhelming.  But as time goes on, we all realize that a little effort done periodically can go a long way. Setting money aside to gradually accumulate for certain purchases would ensure a more active/flexible way of saving money.
It can be extremely effective, fun, and simple. It’s easy to become demotivated from constantly checking bank applications or money management apps like Mint. Such applications are very general and stationary in financial planning, and do little besides just listing numbers. With a lighthearted money saving app focused on achievements and user satisfaction, the biggest issue in money management will be tackled: motivation. Therefore, our project aims to help youths learning to manage their money and to stay motivated consistently to save up for a high-cost purchase.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="need-finding--user-research">Need Finding &amp; User Research</h2>

<p>Before we started to design our feature, we conducted a survey on the local 
student population through a Google Form that was sent out to popular UCSD 
Facebook pages. We figured a survey would preserve anonymity so people wouldn’t 
have to associate their financial habits with their identities. Our survey process also allowed us to gain an understanding of not just students, but also teens 
 and young adults with their first jobs. 
<br /> <br />
The major findings of our survey are summarized below: 
<br /><br />
<img src="survey.PNG" alt="drawing" width="70%" class="center" />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="research-conclusions">Research Conclusions</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px"> 1.) Students have good control over their money, yet they often do not commit to saving periodically for large purchases</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Feeling overwhelmed by money</li>
  <li>Not being motivated enough</li>
  <li>Difficult to keep track of savings for specific purchases</li>
  <li>Not knowing if the end goal is ever going to happen</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 15px"> 2.) Students are discouraged when trying to save up. </span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Many banking or money management apps simply list numbers of how much the user has spent, so it is up to the user to constantly check back on the app to see their savings.</li>
  <li>Many apps just flood the user with a lot of notifications which tire and eventually annoy the user.</li>
  <li>Throughout the process of saving, the user does not feel a sense of price or accomplishment at how much they have saved so far.</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 15px"> 3.) Students do not have a structured way of saving their money for specific purchases. </span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Most students “saved” up by simply keeping their goal in mind when spending.</li>
  <li>It is easy to lose track of how much the user has actually saved, versus what they recall and believe they saved.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="-design-process"><span style="font-size: 45px"> <b>Design Process</b></span></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s a process, not something dreamt overnight!”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>The key principle of motivation in money management was inspired by the innovative features offered by Mint’s competitors [Digit, Qapital Banking, and Acorns(formerly)] and by Mint’s pre-existing integrations (Acorns). 
However, the most important feature for motivation that was absent in all of these apps was an achievement system which was mainly inspired by the language-learning app, Duolingo.</p>

class="center"/> <br> -->

<p>Thus, to gauge how we should improve Mint, we performed a competitive audit and concluded that Mint (along with its integration with Acorns) needed to include an achievement system along with more user-defined goals.

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h2 id="prototyping--testing">Prototyping + Testing</h2>
<p>When it came to prototyping, our group created UX flows, UI 
sketches, low-fidelity paper prototypes, high-fidelity prototypes. This 
gradual process of prototyping allowed us to evolve our designs while 
receiving much needed feedback at each stage.</p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size: 18px"><i>UX Flows</i></span> <br /><br />
Before we design our feature onto Mint, we had to create UX flows that envisioned how our user was to navigate within the app to either create their goals or to manage their achievements.

<span style="font-size: 16px"><b>Flow 2: Managing User Achievements</b></span> (Click to View)</p>

<p><a href="ux_flow2.PNG"><img src="ux_flow2.PNG" alt="drawing" width="100%" class="center" /></a></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size: 18px"><i>UX Sketches</i></span> <br /> <br />
After the creation of UX flows, we created UI sketches to either conform to 
our UX flows or redefine our thought process.</p>

<p><a href="ui_sketches.PNG"><img src="ui_sketches.PNG" alt="drawing" width="100%" class="center" /></a></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size: 18px"><i>Low Fidelity Paper Prototypes</i></span> <br /><br />
Once the UI sketches were completed, it was time to craft our low-fidelity 
paper prototpyes, these were very crucial for understanding how the user 
initially went through the app and how certain features were anticipated or 
hindered their experience.
<br /> <br /></p>

<p><br />
<span style="font-size: 18px"><i>High Fidelity Paper Prototypes</i></span> 
<br /><br />
After valuable feedback from users testing our low-fidelity prototpyes, we 
went on to develop digital high-fidelity prototypes. These high-fidelity 
prototypes started to show a slight divergence from our UX flows but that is 
expected as the design process progresses.

<h1 id="reflection">Reflection</h1>
<p>After about 10 weeks of this course, I have come to appreciate how the design
 process is important to the life cycle of every project. I have felt that 
 this case study has allowed me to have a hands-on experience in a project’s 
 design lifecycle which in many ways greatly differed from my traditional 
 background in software devlopment and its own lifecycle, SDLC (software 
 development lifecycle). For example, the greatest difference I have felt 
 was the user-testing in this case study. The user-testing was a 
 lot more frequent and had large sweeping changes on our decisions, sometimes more so 
 than I was used to in my experience with software development. As we were 
 developing our design we wanted to give users
  more control over the features but this presented too much information to 
  them; it took us a while until it finally dawned on us that we have lost
   sight of the main principle of our feature, motivation. How could an app 
   be motivating if the user is expected to be very specific and if they 
   would treat using the app like a chore? Our A/B testing using the 
   original Mint app and our design exposed our users’ 
   frustrations on our design and showed for far we truly departed 
   from Mint’s innate minimalist design. Our latter prototypes were then 
   changed (somewhat reluctantly) to make our app more minimalist while 
   retaining the features that truly matter. The end result was fulfilling to
    our users and we have appreciated what we have been able to 
    accomplish. Therefore, this challenge and difficulty we faced is 
   something truly unique to me that sets the design process as a 
   different principle that should be carefully conducted and considered in 
   every project. 
   <br /> <br />
    In the end, we hoped what we have designed would be a potential and 
    enjoyable solution to the problems described in 
   our project statement and we believe most if not all of our objectives were 
   reached. I look forward for any opportunity to improve this project and 
   more opportunities to test this project.</p>
